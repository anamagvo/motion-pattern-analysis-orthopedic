# Recording Guidelines for 3D Pose Estimation

This guide provides detailed instructions for recording videos that will be used for 3D pose estimation and knee angle analysis.

## Camera Setup

- **Positioning**: Place two cameras at approximately 90 degrees to each other
- **Height**: Position cameras at the same height as the subject's hips
- **Stability**: Use tripods to keep cameras stable
- **Lighting**: Ensure good lighting to avoid shadows and motion blur
- **Field of View**: Both cameras should capture the full body of the subject

## Technical Requirements

- **Frame Rate**: 60fps or higher
- **Resolution**: 1080p minimum
- **Format**: High-quality video format (.mov or high-bitrate .mp4)
- **Compression**: Minimize compression artifacts
- **Synchronization**: Both cameras should record at the same frame rate

## Recording Sequence

1. **Calibration Phase** (5-10 seconds):
   - Place checkerboard calibration object in scene
   - Ensure it's visible to both cameras
   - Record from different angles
   - Remove calibration object

2. **Synchronization Marker**:
   - Start both cameras recording
   - Have someone clap loudly or use a flash
   - This creates a clear visual/audio marker in both videos
   - The marker will be used for video synchronization

3. **Motion Capture**:
   - Subject performs the motion
   - Keep motion within both cameras' field of view
   - Avoid rapid movements
   - Prevent occlusions

## Calibration Object Requirements

- **Type**: Checkerboard pattern (black and white squares)
- **Size**: Large enough to be clearly visible
- **Square Size**: Known dimensions (e.g., 2cm x 2cm)
- **Material**: Rigid board to prevent warping
- **Visibility**: Must be visible to both cameras

## Subject Guidelines

- **Clothing**: Wear tight-fitting clothing
- **Starting Position**: Begin in a neutral pose
- **Movement**: Perform motions slowly and smoothly
- **Position**: Stay within both cameras' field of view
- **Avoid**: Rapid movements and body part occlusions

## Best Practices

1. **Before Recording**:
   - Check camera settings
   - Verify lighting conditions
   - Test synchronization method
   - Ensure calibration object is visible

2. **During Recording**:
   - Monitor both camera views
   - Ensure subject stays in frame
   - Watch for potential occlusions
   - Maintain consistent lighting

3. **After Recording**:
   - Verify video quality
   - Check synchronization marker
   - Ensure calibration phase is clear
   - Verify motion is captured properly

## Common Issues to Avoid

- Poor lighting
- Camera movement
- Subject out of frame
- Rapid movements
- Body part occlusions
- Compression artifacts
- Inconsistent frame rates
- Missing synchronization marker
- Unclear calibration object

## File Naming Convention

Use a consistent naming convention for your video files:
```
[SubjectID]_[MotionType]_[CameraPosition]_[Date].mp4
```
Example: `S001_Walk_Cam1_20240315.mp4`

## Additional Tips

- Record multiple takes
- Keep the recording area clear of obstacles
- Use a neutral background if possible
- Mark the subject's position on the floor
- Have a helper monitor the recording process
- Test the setup with a short recording first
